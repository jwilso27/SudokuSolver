#SudokuSolver

This project began as a lab assignment for a computer science course.
The project was written in C++, as C++ was the subject of the course.

##Requirements

This program requires `iostream`, `typeinfo`, `fstream`, `vector`, and `cmath` C++ libraries and g++ to compile.
It was written to run in bash.

##Clone, Compile, and Run

```
git clone https://github.com/jwilso27/SudokuSolver.git
make
solver
```

##Solve

Upon running the program, you will be asked for a file, if it is a sudoku (with numbers) or a wordoku (with letters), and how many rows the sudoku has.
The program works with different sized boards and input types.
